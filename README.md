# tree-style-tab-Firefox-customization

this is my configuration for better integrate Firefox with tree style tab. 

in the userChrome.css there are instruction for:

- removing the tab bar
- removing the header of the side bar
- disable the tooltip when hover over a tab
- move the navbar up and leave the right space for the win 10 buttons
- also reduce the height of the navbar and scale it to match the size of the windows button
